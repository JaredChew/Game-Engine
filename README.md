# NewGameEngine
A controlled experience (fixed usage style) based on the module engine project

The alternate timeline to the 3D module engine but enough modules this time.
I'm taking back control and I will determine how it is used, how it is setup, and how they are linked. So trust me.
It is also my chance to learn and catch-up on the parts that I've missed in the alternate project.

This project also goes hand in hand with the Alternative Writing Standard.
It's application here is for me to practice, develop, and test the conventions written.

I'm out of names, so is it New GameEngine or NewGame Engine?
