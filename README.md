# NewGameEngine
A controlled experience (fixed usage style) based on the module engine project

The alternate timeline to the 3D module engine but enough modules this time.
I'm taking back control and I will determine how it is used, how it is setup, and how they are linked. So trust me.
It is also my chance to learn and catch-up on the parts that I've missed in the alternate project.

I'm out of names, so is it New GameEngine or NewGame Engine?
